# CppBasics

I am using this repo to deposit the codes of C++ language while I am learnig it.
The reference books I am following are, 
1. C++ programming by ULLMAN and SIGNER
2. Teach yourself C++ by Schildt


To run the code, use g++ -o object_filename codefilename.cpp to compile the code
and then use ./object_filename to run the code.

Codes Names and Purpose:

1_hello_world : simple first code to just print out a sentence.
