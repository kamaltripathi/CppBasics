# CppBasics

I am using this repo to deposit the codes of C++ language while I am learnig it.

`g++ -o executable_name codefilename.cpp` to compile the code,

`./executable_name` to execute the executable program.

Codes Names and Purpose:

[1_hello_world](https://github.com/kamaltripathi/CppBasics/tree/main/1_hello_world): simple first code to just print out a sentence.

The reference books I am following are, 
1. C++ programming by ULLMAN and SIGNER
2. Teach yourself C++ by Schildt
